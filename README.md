# d&d-3.5-library
A backup of the beautiful plethora of handbooks created by the 3.5 community over the years, because resources on the internet are so fragile and this content is especially dear to me.

If you wish to contribute, please open a pull request or point me to the location of yet more handbooks in an issue. Thanks!
