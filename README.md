# Dnd 3.5 optimization library
A backup of the beautiful plethora of handbooks created by the 3.5 community over the years, because resources on the internet are so fragile and this content is especially dear to me. The website is visible at https://ehildebrand.github.io/dnd_3.5_library/

This website is based on [Jlord's Sheetsee-pocket Template](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee-pocket).
